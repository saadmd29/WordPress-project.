# Automated WordPress Deployment with Nginx, LEMP Stack, and GitHub Actions

This project demonstrates an automated deployment process for a WordPress website using Nginx as the web server, the LEMP (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP) stack, and GitHub Actions as the CI/CD automation tool. The deployment process is designed to follow security best practices and optimize website performance.

## Server Provisioning

1. Provision a Virtual Private Server (VPS) with a cloud provider i.e AWS to host the WordPress website.
2. Configure the VPS with a secure Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04) and ensure that all necessary firewall rules are applied.
3. Installed and configure Nginx as the web server, MySQL/MariaDB as the database, and PHP for processing dynamic content.

## Website Configuration

4. Set up a WordPress website on the VPS and secure it following best practices (e.g., strong passwords, limited user privileges, etc.).
5. Implement SSL/TLS certificate using Let's Encrypt for secure communication between the server and clients.
6. Optimize the Nginx server configuration to enhance website performance (e.g., caching, gzip compression, etc.).

## GitHub Repository Setup

7. Create a GitHub repository and set up a GitHub Actions workflow for the automated deployment of the WordPress website to the VPS.
8. Ensure that the GitHub Actions workflow includes the necessary steps to install dependencies, build the project, and securely transfer files to the server.
9. Store sensitive information like SSH private keys and database credentials as secrets in GitHub.
